## Machine Learning

This is the class I took in my senior year at TJHSST. The first part of the course mainly focused on using recursion to solve function and math problems. Next,
the labs were on neural network techniques and fitting models to numerical datasets, and transitioned into using established Python models, 
like mnist and kmeans to solve image processing. The class ended with learning about reinforcement learning and Reinforcement Neural Networks (RNN) to
solve the GridWorld and Bandit problems. 

The code files are grouped in different folders for each 'unit' we had in the course.
